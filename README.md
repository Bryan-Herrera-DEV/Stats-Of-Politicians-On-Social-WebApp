# Stats-Of-Politicians-On-Social-WebApp

_Personal Project for Politicians Analysis_

## Introduction

The project aims to make stats about the use of Social Media by Politicians.
It analyzes on any social media, politicians of more countries, of any political group.

## Structure

The structure of the project is designed below.
All the components have been created on Docker.

- **Crawler | Python & Config file (.yml)**: once at a day it reads the YML file (countries, socials, and accounts we have to analyze), fetches all the data, and save them into the db.
- **Database | MySQL**: stores all the data sent by the Crawler.
- **UI | Node.Js, HTML, CSS, JS**: fetches and visualize all the data from the database.
- **Health Checker | Python & Config file (.yml)**: it checks every second the health of all Docker containers. On error (and online return) it sends notifications on Telegram and-or Slack.

### Config File (YML)

It is useful to store socials, countries, accounts, and political groups to analyze. <br/>
I use a YML file rather than a relational DB, because it is more easier to update and store.

Here is an example of what it contains:

![YAML EXAMPLE](/docs/imgs/yaml.png)

### Crawler (Python)

Everyday, at **00:00 AM UTC**, it start a job with three main phases managed by ```Manager```.

- **Reading**: it reads from the YML config file all the info mandatory to make stats. Precisely, it contains socials, countries and their respective political groups and accounts we want to analyze. 
- **Fetching & Processing**: for each social and country, it retrieves data for each account for the day that just passed, and it puts them into an ```Account``` object (one for each account). Once made a list of accounts object, it instantiates a ```Group``` object. These objects make all the stats required for the last 24hrs.
- **Saving**: once made all accounts and politics group objects associated with a given country on a given social, the data are saved throught a ```Helper``` into a database.

Below is illustrated a semplified UML of the crawler. <br/>
It has to be noticed that ```Account```, ```Group```, and ```Helper``` use a **Factory Method Design Pattern**.

### Database (MySQL)

The DBMS which I have chosen to store all the data is MySQL, a relational DBMS. <br/>
It is best suitable for simple operations like write and reading, it is reliable, simple, and faster, etc. <br/>

Below is illustrated a logical schema of the database (generated by **phpMyAdmin**).

### UI (Node, HTML, CSS, JS)

Node.Js connects to MySQL. <br/>
UI has been implemented using HTML, CSS, and JS. <br/>
On request, via REST APIs using AJAX, NodeJs returns what we need.

Let's see API calls:

``/api/countries``: gets all coutries (e.g. ITA).<br/>
``/api/:country/groups``: gets all political groups of :country analysed yesterday.<br/>
``/api/:country/:social/accounts``: gets all accounts of :country on :social analysed yesterday.<br/>
``/api/:social/accounts/:group/all``: gets all accounts in :group on :social analysed yesterday.<br/>

``/api/:social/accounts/:handle/info``: gets yesterday info about :handle on :social.<br/>
``/api/:social/accounts/:handle/insights``: gets yesterday insights about :handle on :social.<br/>
``/api/:social/accounts/:handle/hashtags/:since/:limit``: gets top :limit used hashtags by :handle since :since.<br/>
``/api/:social/accounts/:handle/history/:operation/:since``: gets history of :operation since :since for :handle.<br/>

``/api/:social/groups/:group/info``: gets yesterday info about :group on :social.<br/>
``/api/:social/groups/:group/insights``: gets yesterday insights about :group on :social.<br/>
``/api/:social/groups/:group/history/:operation/:since``: gets history of :operation since :since for :group.<br/>

## Getting Started

So that the repository is successfully cloned and project run smoothly, a few steps need to be followed.

### Requisites

* A good and stable internet connection. 
* Use of Linux, MacOS, or Windows WSL.
* Having a Twitter Developer Account with related keys and tokens (for Twitter).
* Having a Telegram Bot (with related channel) or a Slack WebHook.
* Need to download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) ([Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is recommended).
* The use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is strongly recommended for modify.

### Installation and Use

```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/antonioscardace/Stats-Of-Politicians-On-Socials-WebApp.git
   $ cd YOUR_PATH/Stats-Of-Politicians-On-Socials-WebApp/
   $ bash run.sh
``` 

## To Do Improvements

- [ ] Add other countries in addition to Italy.
- [ ] Add other socials (e.g. Instagram).
- [ ] Add other NLP stats (e.g. Emotion Detection).
- [ ] Re-implement front-end using Vue.js or similar.
- [ ] Re-design Node.Js back-end to be hybrid with more socials and countries. Design Patterns...
- [ ] Refactoring NODE-UI codes (especially .js files).
