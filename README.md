# Stats-Of-Politicians-On-Social-WebApp

_Personal Project for Politicians Analysis_

## Introduction

The project aims to make stats about the use of Social Media by Politicians.
It analyzes on any social media, politicians of more countries, of any political group.

## Structure

The structure of the project is designed below.
All the components have been created on Docker.

- **Config file (.yml)**: has been created to store countries, socials, and accounts we have to analyze.
- **Crawler | Python**: once at a day it reads the YML file, fetches all the data, and save them into the db.
- **Database | MySQL**: stores all the data sent by the Crawler.
- **UI | NodeJs, HTML, CSS, JS**: fetches and visualize all the data from the database.

### Config File (YML)

It is useful to store socials, countries, accounts, and political groups to analyze. <br/>
I use a YML file rather than a relational DB, because it is more easier to update and store.

Here is an example of what it contains:

![YAML EXAMPLE](/docs/imgs/yaml.png)

### Crawler (Python)

Everyday, at **00:00 AM tz:UTC**, it start a job with three main phases managed by ```Manager```.

- **Reading**: it reads from the YML config file all the info mandatory to make stats. Precisely, it contains socials, countries and their respective political groups and accounts we want to analyze. 
- **Fetching & Processing**: for each social and country, it retrieves data for each account for the day that just passed, and it puts them into an ```Account``` object (one for each account). Once made a list of accounts object, it instantiates a ```Group``` object. These objects make all the stats required for the last 24hrs.
- **Saving**: once made all accounts and politics group objects associated with a given country on a given social, the data are saved throught a ```Helper``` into a database.

Below is illustrated a semplified UML of the crawler. <br/>
It has to be noticed that ```Account```, ```Group```, and ```Helper``` use a **Factory Method Design Pattern**.

### Database (MySQL)

The DBMS which I have chosen to store all the data is MySQL, a relational DBMS. <br/>
It is best suitable for simple operations like write and reading, it is reliable, simple, and faster, etc. <br/>

Below is illustrated a logical schema of the database (generated by **phpMyAdmin**).

### UI (Node, HTML, CSS, JS)

NodeJs connects to MySQL. <br/>
UI has been implemented using HTML, CSS, and JS. <br/>
On request, via REST APIs using AJAX, NodeJs returns what we need.

Below is illustrated a semplified UML of how the NodeJs server is organized. <br/>
